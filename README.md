# Tech School

## Our manifesto

Tech School is a movement that fights for free access to quality education in the area of technology. We are against the big programming teaching conglomerates, which are responsible for making knowledge accessible only to the financially privileged.

There are thousands of free and quality courses spread over the internet, however, we don't have millions of dollars to invest in marketing. Thus, when a beginner tries to enter the area, he ends up facing expensive and predatory courses first, generating the false feeling that it is mandatory to disburse a lot of money.

Tech School came to jointly promote free courses that did not have the visibility they deserved. Only then will we be able to face the market sharks. Our site has a collection of courses in different areas, allowing anyone to go from zero to their first job without having to suffer any financial loss.

# The Tech Stack

This is a [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) project bootstrapped with [`mix phx.new techschool --database sqlite3`](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Mix.Tasks.Phx.New.html). Besides Phoenix, the only framework used is [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

To start your Phoenix server:

- Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
