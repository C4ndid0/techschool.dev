# Our manifesto

Tech School is all about making tech education accessible to everyone for free. There are tons of awesome courses online, but we don't have big bucks for marketing. So, newbies often run into the expensive courses first, making it seem like you have to shell out a ton of money.

That's where Tech School steps in. We're here to shine a light on those awesome free courses that might be flying under the radar. Our website has a bunch of courses covering different areas. The goal? Help anyone go from zero to landing their first job without breaking the bank. We want to tackle the expensive course culture and make tech education fair and equal for everyone.

# The Tech Stack

This is a [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) project bootstrapped with [SQLite3](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto_sqlite3/Ecto.Adapters.SQLite3.html) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

To run TechSchool locally:

- Install [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html)
- Install [Phoenix](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html)
- Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

If you just want to seed the database with courses, run `mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs` or `mix ecto.reset` to drop the database, re-run the migrations and seed the database.

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
